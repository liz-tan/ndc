    "## Building an NLP pipeline to analyse NDCs and track contributions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Countries submit their updated NDCs (NDC 3.0) in 2025. Each round of NDCs should be more ambitious than the last to put us on track to limit warming under 2 degrees. The next [Global Stocktake](https://unfccc.int/documents/631600) will take place in 2028, and is critical for checking progress toward the Paris Agreement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Given the urgency of climate action required, can we check on the progress towards emissions reductions and resilience in each commitment in real time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What can we learn from NDCs to understand how to address financing gaps?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do mitigation, adaptation and L&D feature in NDCs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "- Step 1: Collect the NDC Data --> Scrape the NDC Registry for links to NDCs\n",
    "- Step 2: Download the NDC texts --> Download from the scraped links\n",
    "- Step 3: Preprocess the Text Data --> Convert unstructured NDC text into clean, structured format for analysis.\n",
    "- Step 4: Compare Ambition Over Time --> Track changes in emissions reduction targets over time.\n",
    "- Step 5: Identify Key Sectors & Financial Instruments --> Extract mentions of economic sectors (e.g., energy, transport) and financial instruments (e.g., carbon pricing, green bonds).\n",
    "- Step 6: Visualise the Findings on a Global Map --> Show how each country's ambition score has changed across NDC updates.\n",
    "- Step 7: Automate & Scale the Pipeline --> Make this process reproducible for future NDC updates."

Health\\nNamibia ranks 168 of 193 countries in 2022 with an average life expectancy of 64.86 years15. Females stand at 67.67 years\\nand males at 61.83. The five leading causes of inpatient deaths (all age groups) are HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea, tuberculosis,\\npneumonia and malaria. Namibia is highly vulnerable to the adverse health implications from projected future climates which\\nmay have direct and indirect impacts on human health through impacts on water quality and availability, extreme weather\\nevents, nutritional status of humans, as well as distribution and abundance of vector organisms due to changing temperature\\nand rainfall patterns and heat stress. Three adaptation measures, comprising 12 actions aim at improving health facilities\\ncoupled with enhanced monitoring and management of diseases.

Therefore, responding to climate change issues is top on the national\\ndevelopment agenda. That is why Ghana committed to implementing thirty-one mitigation and\\nadaptation actions across seven economic sectors in its nationally determined contribution to\\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015.\\nIn line with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement and UNFCCC decisions 1/CP.21 and 4/CMA.1,\\nGhana has updated its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement from\\n2020 to 2030, considering its unique circumstances. The update affirms the country\\'s resolve\\nto address the impacts of climate change on the country\\'s economy and its vulnerable people.\\nThe update covers 19 policy areas and translates into 47 adaptation and mitigation\\nprogrammes of action. The 47 climate actions are expected to build the resilience of over 38\\nmillion people, generate absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions of 64 MtCO e, create\\n2\\nover one million jobs, avoid 2,900 deaths due to improved air quality by 2030.\\nThe update of the nationally determined contribution was based on extensive stakeholder\\nconsultations with relevant institutions at both national and sub-national levels, with the\\ninvolvement of Ministries, Departments and Agencies, Metropolitan, Municipal, and District\\nAssemblies, development partners, private sector, academia and Civil Society Organisations.\\nThe Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation will work with relevant sector\\ninstitutions and stakeholders to implement the nationally determined contribution to\\naccelerate our development efforts and enhance the well-being of our people.\\nIt is my cherished hope that the Updated Nationally Determined Contribution will serve as a\\nblueprint for transitioning into a climate-resilient low carbon economy that will accelerate our\\ndevelopment efforts and enhance the well-being of our people without sacrificing the quality\\nof the environment and its resources.\\n4Abbreviations\\nAU Africa Union\\nAPR Annual Progress Report\\nBTR Biennial Transparency Report\\nCDM Clean Development Mechanism\\nCLIMFINTRACK Climate Finance Tracking\\nCARP Climate Ambitious Report Programme\\nCMA Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\\nAgreement\\nCOVID-19 Coronavirus disease\\nCARES COVID-19 Alleviation and Revitalization of Enterprises Support\\nCoP Conference of parties\\nCSO Civil Society Organizations\\nEPA Environmental Protection Agency\\nEMEP/EEA European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/European Environment\\nAgency\\nGDP Gross Domestic product\\nGHG Greenhouse Gas\\nGACMO Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Model\\nHFCs Hydrofluorocarbons\\nIPPU Industrial Processes and Product Use\\nIPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\nITMOs Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes\\nKt/year Kilotons per year\\nLULUCF Land use land-use change and forestry\\nLEAP Low Emissions Analysis Platform\\nMDA Ministries, Department and Agencies\\nMESTI Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation\\nM&E Monitoring and Evaluation\\nMMDAs Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies\\nMtCO e Million Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent\\n2\\nNDPC National Development Planning Commission\\nNDC Nationally Determined Contribution\\nPM Particulate Matter 2.5\\n2.5\\nSDG Sustainable Development Goals\\nSLCPs Short-Lived Climate Pollutants\\nSO Sulphur Dioxide\\n2\\nUNFCCC United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\nVOCs Volatile Organic Compounds\\nVALCO Volta Aluminium Company\\nWOGA Whole-Ghana-Approach\\n5Acknowledgement\\nThe preparation of Ghana\\'s revised nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC has\\nbeen two years of a great learning experience, collaborations and amazing teamwork.

Introduction\\nGhana is pleased to announce its updated and enhanced nationally determined contribution\\nunder the Paris Agreement for 2020 to 2030, per Article 4 of the Paris Agreement and UNFCCC\\ndecisions 1/CP.21 and 4/CMA.1. By this communication, and consistent with UNFCCC\\ndecision 1/CP. 21, paragraph 24, Ghana affirms the nationally determined contribution it put\\nforward in 2015. There is an urgent need for collective, ambitious and meaningful global\\nefforts to keep the global temperature well below two degrees and avoid the irreversible\\nconsequences on the climate-vulnerable countries. Ghana is a member of the Africa Union\\n(AU) and holds in high esteem the geopolitical position of Africa in pursuing the agenda 2063.\\nIn updating the nationally determined contribution, Ghana was mindful of the need to:\\n• embrace the AU and align to new policy changes to safeguard the development\\nprospects of the country;\\n• enhance implementation of climate actions by strengthening the mobilisation of public,\\nprivate and grassroots participation; and\\n• increasing the investment credentials and ambition across mitigation, finance and\\nadaptation.\\n• put Ghana\\'s development on an accelerated path for achieving\" a resilient and low\\ncarbon society by promoting economic growth, climate protection and air quality\\nbenefits, youth and women empowerment and social inclusion in the next decade and\\nbeyond\".\\nTo this end, the revised and enhanced nationally determined contribution reflect aspirations\\nof goal 1, paragraphs 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the AU\\'s agenda 2063.\\n2. Ghana\\'s Updated Nationally Determined Contribution\\nThe national development strategy to build a resilient society that can adequately withstand\\nthe impacts of climate change and contribute to mitigating global emissions is well on course.\\nAs part of the national strategy, Ghana has developed 19 policy actions in 10 priority areas to\\nachieve nationally determined contribution goals in the next decade. The 19 policy actions\\ntranslate into 13 adaptation and 34 mitigation programmes of action (referred to as\\nmeasures). The 19 policy actions that have the potential to maximise the synergies between\\nadaptation and economic diversification, resulting in mitigation co-benefits, will lead to the\\nfollowing outcomes in the long term:\\n• Accelerate sustainable energy transition\\n• Build resilient economies and societies\\n• Enhance early warning and disaster risk management\\n• Enhance landscape restoration\\n• Ensure responsible production and consumption\\n• Foster social inclusion focusing on youth and women\\n• Provide smart and safe communities\\n8Ghana expects that implementing the 19 policy actions will achieve the following by 2030:\\n• Generate absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions of 64 MtCO e.\\n2\\n• Avoid at least 2,900 premature deaths per year from improved air quality.\\n• Create over one million1 decent and green jobs and\\n• Benefit cumulatively nearly 38 million people, with the majority being the youth and\\nwomen.\\nThe 13 adaptation measures are divided into seven unconditional2 and six conditional3\\nprogrammes of action. For the 34 mitigation measures, Ghana aims to implement nine\\nunconditional programmes of action that would result in 8.5 MtCO e GHG reductions by 2025\\n2\\nand a further 24.6 MtCO e by 2030 compared to the 2020-2030 cumulative emissions in a\\n2\\nbaseline scenario. Ghana can also adopt additional 25 conditional programmes of action that\\nhave the potential to achieve 16.7 MtCO e by 2025 and 39.4 MtCO e by 2030 if financial\\n2 2\\nsupport from the international and private sector is made available to cover the full cost for\\nimplementation.\\n3. Nationally Determined Contribution and National Development\\nGhana anticipates that the updated nationally determined contribution will play a key role in\\nachieving the long-term national development objectives for the country and the global\\nsustainable development goals. That is why this updated nationally determined contribution\\ndocument strongly aligns with the various national and sector policies and is backed by\\nconcrete programmes that the Ministries Department and Agencies (MDA), Metropolitan,\\nMunicipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), private sector, and civil society organisations can\\nimplement. The updated and enhanced nationally determined contribution responds to the\\nsustainability priorities in the following national policy documents:\\n• Ghana @ 100 frameworks and the accompanying national Infrastructure plan.\\n• Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policy.\\n• 2022 to 2025 Medium-Term Development Policy Framework.\\n• Ghana Beyond Aid Charter Strategy Document.\\n• COVID-19 Alleviation and Revitalisation of Enterprises Support\\n1 Ghana plans to conduct a comprehensive analysis of job potentials and economic diversification\\nopportunities for each of the nationally determined contribution sectors and at the economy-level.\\n2 Climate measures that the financial resources have been secured to cover the full or partial cost of\\nimplementation at the time of publication. It is also including measures that have high socio-economic\\nbenefits, aligns with the Government priorities, have received financial commitment, and is cost-effective,\\nfor which the Government do not need external support for its implementation.\\n3 Climate measures that are outside the scope of the unconditional definition, and facing market, regulatory\\nand technological barriers and unlikely to receive Government support to implement them.\\n94. Making the Nationally Determined Contribution Work\\nRemoving the systematic institutional, policy, and financial barriers is the surest way to make\\nthe nationally determined contribution work and positively affect the lives of the vulnerable.\\nIt means that the updated nationally determined contribution must fully respond to\\ngovernment policy needs; be coordinated by capable national institutions, and have access to\\nadequate finance and technology from the international and private sectors.\\n4.1 Institutional Support for Ghana\\'s Nationally Determined Contribution\\nThe Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) coordinates the\\nupdated nationally determined contribution process and advocates resource allocation at the\\nCabinet and parliamentary levels. MESTI will also facilitate the future periodic updates of the\\nnationally determined contribution, considering inputs from the global stocktake and the latest\\nscientific evidence. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will track and report the\\nprogress of implementing the nationally determined contribution across the nation and\\nregularly publish progress, achievements, and challenges in the Biennial Transparency Report\\n(BTR) consistent with the UNFCCC Decision 18/CMA.1 on Modalities, Procedures and\\nGuidelines for the Transparency Framework. To this end:\\n• The EPA and MESTI will advocate adopting appropriate carbon pricing measures,\\nincluding the operationalisation of Article 6 and other international carbon market\\ninstruments to support green businesses, create jobs and facilitate technology\\ntransfer.\\n• The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will continue to mobilise and track inflows from the\\nGovernment, development partners, and the private sector to implement nationally\\ndetermined contributions.\\n• The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) will continue to facilitate the\\nmainstreaming of the nationally determined contribution into the sector and district\\nplans and annual progress report to monitor the nationally determined contribution.\\n4.3 Financial Needs for Implementing the Revised Nationally Determined Contribution\\nGhana requires between US$ 9.3 and US$ 15.5 billion4 of investment to implement the 47\\nnationally determined contribution measures from 2020 to 2030. US$ 3.9 billion would be\\nrequired to implement the 16 unconditional programmes of action till 2030. The remaining\\nUS$ 5.4 billion for the 31 conditional programmes of action would be mobilised from the\\npublic, international, and private sector sources and carbon markets. Ghana will need an\\nadditional US$ 3 million biennially to support coordination actions and the regular\\ninternational reporting of the nationally determined contribution.\\n4.4 Technology and Capacity Needs for the Revised Nationally Determined Contribution\\nTechnology and know-how are a catalyst for implementing the 47 measures to deliver the\\nnationally determined contribution. Ghana will continue to promote rapid technology\\ndeployment and support the transfer of suitable emerging technologies to meet the country\\'s\\nneeds.\\n4 Detailed investment estimate will be provided in the NDC investment strategy. Furthermore, Ghana will\\nreport on the actual investments in the nationally determined contribution in its biennial transparency report\\nto the UNFCCC consistent with UNFCCC decision 18/CMA.1 Annex 5 sections C and D.\\n10Ghana also plans to integrate capacity development into the overall implementation plan for\\nthe nationally determined contribution. Emphasis will be on continuous staff training,\\ndeliberate involvement of academic institutions in the training programme, research and\\nevidence gathering to inform the regular update of nationally determined contribution and\\nparticipation in the global stocktake. Furthermore, Ghana hopes to strengthen the involvement\\nof civil society organisations and traditional authorities to mobilise public support and ensure\\nthe flow of information from the national to the community levels and vice versa.\\n5. National Arrangement for Tracking Nationally Determined Contribution\\nArticle 13 of the Paris Agreement provides the transparency framework for reporting progress\\nand achievement of the nationally determined contribution, the national greenhouse inventory\\nand climate support. Ghana aims to operationalise its integrated climate data and carbon\\nregistry platform for managing and reporting transactions involving Internationally Transferred\\nMitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under the cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris\\nAgreement consistent with UNFCCC Decision 18/CMA.1 paragraph 77 (d).\\nGhana will use the established structures for the Climate Ambitious Report Programme (CARP)\\nand Annual Progress Report (APR) as the National Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) backbone\\nto regularly track and report progress and achievement of all the 47 measures. Information\\nfrom the APR (managed by the National Development Planning Commission), climate data and\\ncarbon registry system (hosted by the Environmental Protection Agency) and the CLIMFINTRAC,\\n(managed by the Ministry of Finance) for tracking climate finance will feed into the annual\\nnationally determined contribution progress report for the Ghana Government and the\\ninternational reports such as National Communication, National Adaptation Communication,\\nBiennial Transparency Report and National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Document.\\n116.
